      <p>
        Ok lets start at the beginning, I was born into a long line of
        engineers. My father has been working in startups my whole life. My
        Uncles worked for Intel and IBM. Remember those intel space guys in that
        one commercial? That is when coding first became part of my life. <br />
        <br />
        And I have spent the majority of my time since then actively avoiding
        that path. Meanwhile, doing a host of things wholly unrelated to
        comp-sci: slinging pizzas, operating a photography business with my wife
        for 10+ years, debating on facebook. And then, for reasons so complex I
        am not sure I fully understand them, namely covid-19, pretty much
        everything stopped. The whole world. <br />
        <br /> This was the time, time to reclaim my nerdy heritage. It was time
        to learn to code. So for the past few months I have been writing,
        thinking, eating, drinking, sleeping, dreaming, CODE. And I can’t
        believe I am saying this but now, I too, am a software engineer, like my
        father, and my uncles and my cousins. I cannot tell you how excited I am
        about that! Maybe a little too excited. I have always wanted to change
        the world in some way, and maybe this is how it will happen. Or, maybe
        that will just be my daughter. Either way I can’t wait to see where this
        road leads. <br />
        <br />I don’t know if I will be the person who reinvents the internet or
        starts the new colony on mars. But who knows. <br />
        <br /> I dream big!
