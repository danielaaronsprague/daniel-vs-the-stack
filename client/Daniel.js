        Ok lets start at the beginning, remember these Intel Engineers?
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          id='intel'
          className='title-item'
          src='/intel.jpg'
          alt='Intel MMX technology people'
        ></img>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you don't remember them, lets just say it was back when they came out
        back when the Intel Pentium Processers were new technology. My uncle
        worked for intel at the time and gave all of the kids in our family one
        of these for christmas one year and since then coding has always been
        something I was interested in! I still remember when I was 11 and my dad
        taught me how to printf 'hello world' on our old windows 95 machine
        <br />
        <br />
        Since then I have strayed from the engineering life. All the while
        performing a host of duties wholly unrelated to comp-sci: slinging
        pizzas, operating a photography business with my wife for 10+ years,
        debating on facebook. And then, for reasons so complex I am not sure I
        fully understand them, namely covid-19, pretty much everything stopped.
        The whole world.
        <br />
        <br /> This was the time, time to reclaim my nerdy heritage. It was time
        to learn to code. So for the past many months I have been writing,
        thinking, eating, drinking, sleeping, dreaming, CODE. It has been one of
        the most exhilarating and fun times of my life! And I can’t believe I am
        saying this but now, I too, am a software engineer, like my father, and
        my uncles and my cousins. I cannot tell you how excited I am about that!
        Maybe a little too excited. I have always wanted to change the world in
        some way, and maybe this is how it will happen. Or, maybe that will just
        be my daughter. Either way I can’t wait to see where this road leads.
        Maybe it is you who I will work with! Hello!
        <br />
        <br />
        Either way I don’t know if I will be the person who reinvents the
        internet or starts the new colony on mars. But who knows. <br />
        <br /> I dream big!
